# Cal Beach

The mobile app is a presentation of beaches in California with includes data like the name, location, description, available facilities, etc... It allows users to make an account and when logged in create a list of their favorite places. There are three main pages, a homepage with a list of places, a beach details page, and a favorites page. 
This project also includes a backend, an RoR API.
